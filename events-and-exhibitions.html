                <p class="margin text-align">On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica exhibition is coming to the Community Science Museum. It's a series of installations that allow visitors to experience the power of the elements as we harness them. From solar energy powering lighting, to 'Wind Island' that shows how turbines are able to use and control wind to create power.</p>

                <p class="margin text-align">For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.

Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant.
